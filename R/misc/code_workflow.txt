1) Create directory structure root/state/county
     "create_directories.R"

2) Check workspace, temp directory and verify/install
     required packages "AddPackages.R" and "library.R" 
	 
3) Run code for establishing a "for loop" that will iterate through
     the directory structure and execute each sub-function process

- download data "data_acquisition.R" and process into common 
    resolution and extent
- Normalize climate data and derive climate metrics
- Create raster stack object containing all parameters
**** Parameter sets ****
climate variables
  - mean annual precipitation
  - mean annual temperature
  - dd5
  - dd0
Geomorphometric
  - Compound Topographic Index
  - TPI
  - 
Soil Attributes
  - 
  -  
 
- Create a proportional random point sample using the SSURGO data and 
    process NASS values (y, dependent variable) and raster values 
	(x, independent variables). 
- Run model selection for probabilistic random forests
- Make spatial probabilistic prediction of final model
- Produce diagnostic and inference plots
- Write validation statistics and calculate uncertainty (confidence interval)
